        We decide to design a 3D video game as the ENSE400 project. 
The process is complicated but we're going to learn the C# and Unity3D 
as the essential software. For the future plan, we decide to learn 
some picture and audio skills for the game. After two weeks learning,
we can use the unity3D and C# to create some simple sences.
